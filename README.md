TimeDropper-Ex is nearly complete rewrite of the original [TimeDropper](https://github.com/felicegattuso/timedropper).

It incoporated [patches from many peer forks](https://github.com/Adam5Wu/TimeDropper-Ex/network),

It improves visual and interactive control experiences, and is slightly more modularized for use without input control.
